- **Backend**: Bun + Hono + TypeScript + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Authentication**: Better-Auth (shared between frontend and backend)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM migrations
- **Package Manager**: Bun (for faster performance)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Styling**: Shadcn UI + TailwindCSS for Twitter-like design
